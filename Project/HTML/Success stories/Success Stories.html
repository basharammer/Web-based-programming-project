              gaming. <b>Super Mario Bros.</b> laid the foundation for the entire Mario franchise, which remains one of

              such as spiders and scorpions. <b>Centipede</b> was unique for its use of a trackball controller, which
              offered a more intuitive way to control movement. The game was especially popular among female players,
              which was unusual for the time. It went on to become one of the highest-grossing arcade games of its era,
